# Pokémon listing made with Next.js. 

<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/baracktocat.jpg" width="15%" align="right">

This time, guided by the professor of an online course, I learned and put into practice several coding techniques, and I got to know several facilitating libs that allowed the realization of this project. It was my first contact with Next.js. It is an application to list the first generation Pokémon, but it is possible to search for all Pokémon by name or id until the date of the last commit.<br>

## How to run application:

### To install all project dependences:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

### To view the application in the browser via localhost:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Thanks for the visit!
